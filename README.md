## Night Length Application

An application that calculates night length on any given day in any given location on Earth. In addition, it finds the time of sunrise, sunset and the times
of civil, nautical and astronomical twilights. The calculations are based on a [formula](http://edwilliams.org/sunrise_sunset_algorithm.htm) from *"Almanac For Computers"*.

Tech stack:
-   Javascript, HTML, CSS
-   [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Carto](https://carto.com/basemaps/) tiles
-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
-   [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)

Application is deployed [here](https://night-length-app.herokuapp.com/).
